Description:
Code Hero is a Educational Game on the topic of Computer Progamming Fundamentals. The game is design to reinforce computer programming fundamentals
by allowing children to play a game with elements from platforms and role playing games while answering questions to beat enemies and get to the
goal at the end of the level. It focuses on loop structures, data types, and other common fundamentals instead of any particular programming
languages so that children can learn the basics.
The idea was to make a game like others played in elementry school classrooms that are on topics of math and science. With Computer Classes becoming
more common and technology more universal we are moving towards a time when learning computer fundamentals could become as common as learning math.

Technology:
This project was developed primarly with Unity Game Engine.

Instructions for Use:
To edit or run this game you will need to download Unity from https://unity.com/. If you wish to play by building a .exe file open the project in
Unity and go to file>buildsettings then make a build for PC.

Controls:
To play the game use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move. Space bar jumps. Any buttons are interacted with the mouse pointer and clicking. If the
character jumps into the wall they will hang onto it and space bar will wall jump. Once you encounter an enemy you will answer questions to attack and
heal to defeat the enemy.

Future of the Project:
Currently the game runs on internal text files for the databases. In the future we could expand the game to an online database to provide support
and updates to teachers. The questions that are in the game so far were created by the development team who are all Computer Science Majors. In the
future the game could have support from educators to ensure questions are well developed and of an apropriate difficulty.
